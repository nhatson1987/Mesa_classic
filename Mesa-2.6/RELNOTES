                           Mesa 2.6 release notes


Highlights
----------

Many bug fixes since Mesa 2.5.

Performance optimizations for GLQuake and GLQuake II.

See the VERSIONS file for details.


Demo directories
----------------

The demo directories were renamed:

	Old Name	New Name
	demos/		xdemos/
	gdemos/		demos/


3Dfx/Glide
----------

The 3Dfx Glide Mesa driver has been updated to v0.21.  GLQuake should
run faster and better than ever.

For optimum GLQuake performance, compile Mesa using the linux-386-quake-glide
target.

When compiling for 'linux-glide' the libMesaGL.so file automatically
links with the 3Dfx glid2x and texus libraries.  This relieves users
from explicitly linking with -lglide2x and -ltexus.  However, the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must still be defined correctly.

If you've installed Glide in /usr/local/glide and Mesa in /usr/local/Mesa
then you would at least have:

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/usr/local/glide/lib:/usr/local/Mesa/lib"



3Dfx/Glide window / full-screen mode
------------------------------------

The new XMesaSetFXmode() function can be used to switch between full-screen
and window rendering mode on the fly.  See the 3Dfx/demos/tunnel.c program
for an example.  You have to set the -DXMESA flag in the Makefile's COPTS
to enable it.


Threading
---------

Initial support for multi-threading now included.  See the README.THREADS
file.
